# Key Ideas/Points

- Create a main folder that has the following subfolders:

  - tesla_xlights_show_folder_modified
    - This folder should be left basically untouched other than MODEL edits made through the xlights tooling.
    - The tesla_xlights_show_modified folder contains submodels to isolate sets of lights on top of the show folder that is available from the tesla repo referenced above.
  - lightshow folders
    - These only contain the .wav, .fseq, .xsq folders generated by xlights

# Workflow

- Open xlights
- Open a new SHOW FOLDER - select the "tesla_xlights_show_modified" folder
- Create a new sequence

# Prep for use in the car

- On a basically blank USB,

  - Create LightShow folder
  - In that folder put the .fseq and .wav (or .mp3) folders from the show you created.
  - Change their names to be "lightshow.fseq" and "lightshow.wav" on the stick.

- Download the folder structure as per instructions in link above.
- Download xlights app
- Start up xlights
  - WITHIN xlights you will need to make the left pane narrower to be able to see the 3D Preview checkbox.

# Things to Know About

- In Sequencer:

  - There's a "single strand" effect that can be used to make chasing lights and stuff like that.

- Sub Models are your friend
  - Using the tesla_node2light_mapping files you can create submodels that represent subsets of lights and stuff.
