# Key Ideas/Points

- Create a main folder that has the following subfolders:

  - tesla_xlights_show_folder_modified
    - This folder should be left basically untouched other than MODEL edits made through the xlights tooling.
    - The tesla_xlights_show_modified folder contains submodels to isolate sets of lights on top of the show folder that is available from the tesla repo referenced above.
  - lightshow folders
    - These only contain the .wav, .fseq, .xsq folders generated by xlights

# Workflow

- Open xlights
  - File > Preferences > Sequences > FSEQ Version, select "V2 Uncompressed"
- Open a new SHOW FOLDER - select the "tesla_xlights_show_modified" folder.
  This version of the "Model S" model includes submodels for things like "lights only" or "front lights only" so that you can easily apply effects to subsets of nodes (i.e.lights, doors, windows).
- Prep the show panels
  - Make sure the "3D" box is checked in the "Layouts" view.
- Create a new sequence or copy and modify an existing sequence.
  - Select the Sequencer tab. For the best editing experience, only the timeline, House Preview, and Color windows are needed.

# Creating a Sequence - Tips and Tricks

- The "Single Strand" effect is a friend here. It provides easy ways to create cascades and flows along the lights.
- View -> Windows -> Effect Settings is your friend here since it allows you to change the settings for an effect.

# Prep for use in the car

- On a basically blank USB,

  - Create LightShow folder
  - In that folder put the .fseq and .wav (or .mp3) folders from the show you created.
  - Change their names to be "lightshow.fseq" and "lightshow.wav" on the stick.
